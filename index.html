        A software supply chain is the series of steps performed when writing,
        testing, packaging, and distributing software. A typical software
        supply chain is composed of multiple steps "chained" together that
        transform (e.g., compilation) or verify the state (e.g., linting) of
        the project in order to drive it to a final product.  <br/>

        Supply chain security is crucial to the overall security of a software
        product.  An attacker who is able to control a step in the supply chain
        can alter the product for malicious intents that range from introducing
        backdoors in the source code to including vulnerable libraries in the
        final product. Because it is susceptible to these threats, supply chain
        breaches are an impactful means for an attacker to affect multiple
        users at once.<br/>

        Although many frameworks ensuring security in the "last mile" (e.g.,
        software updaters) exist, they may be providing integrity and
        authentication to a product that is already vulnerable; it is possible
        that, by the time the package makes it to a software update repository,
        it has already been compromised.  <br/>

        Toto is designed to ensure the integrity of a software product from
        initiation to end-user installation. It does so by making it
        transparent to the user what steps were performed, by whom and in what
        order. As a result, given guidance by the group creating the software,
        Toto allows the user to verify if a step in the supply chain was
        intended to be performed, and if the step was performed by the right
        actor.  <br/>
