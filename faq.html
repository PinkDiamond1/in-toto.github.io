<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
1. Why the name "in-toto"?
in-toto is Latin for â€œas a whole". It is the first framework that holistically enforces the integrity of a software supply chain by gathering cryptographically verifiable information about the chain itself, from development to installation of the software.

2. What is the difference between in-toto and TUF?
The Update Framework (TUF) and in-toto are two faces of a coin. While TUF provides a framework (a set of libraries, file formats, and utilities) that can be used to secure new and existing software update systems, in-toto scans the entire software supply chain to make sure that all the stakeholders involved in development, build and shipment of the software produce exactly what they are supposed to. Together, they provide end-to-end protection for the whole software supply chain.

3. Is Python 3 supported?
Yes, Python 3 is supported with in-toto.

4. Is there a timeline for the support of Python 2.7?
Currently, we do not have any plans to retire Python 2.7 in the near future.
