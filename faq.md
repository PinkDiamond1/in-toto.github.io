<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

1. *__Why the name "in-toto"?__*

    in-toto is Latin for "as a whole". We chose the name because our objective
    with in-toto is to build a system to protect the whole software supply
    chain.

1. *__What is the difference between in-toto and TUF?__*

    TUF provides a framework that can be used to secure update systems (i.e.,
    the last mile), whereas in-toto lets you verify the whole software supply
    chain. TUF and in-toto can play together very well, as you can use TUF to
    deliver updates and their corresponding in-toto metadata.

1. *__Is Python 3 supported?__*

    Yes, Python 3 is supported with in-toto.

1. *__Is there a timeline for the support of Python 2.7?__*

    Since some of our adopters don't plan on phasing out of Python2, we are
    also not planning to phase it out any time soon.
