        A software supply chain is the series of steps performed when writing,
        testing, packaging, and distributing software. A typical software
        supply chain is composed of multiple steps "chained" together that
        transform (e.g., compilation) or verify the state (e.g., linting) of
        the project in order to drive it to a final product.
        </p>

        <p>
        Supply chain security is crucial to the overall security of a software
        product.  An attacker who is able to control a step in the supply chain
        can alter the product for malicious intents that range from introducing
        backdoors in the source code to including vulnerable libraries in the
        final product. As a result, supply chain breaches are an impactful
        means for an attacker to affect multiple users at once.
        <p>

        <p>
        Although many frameworks exist to ensure security in the "last mile"
        (e.g., software updaters), they may be providing integrity and
        authentication to a product that is already vulnerable; it is possible
        that, by the time the package makes it to a software update repository,
        it has already been compromised.
        </p>

        <p>
        in-toto is designed to ensure the integrity of a software product from
        initiation to end-user installation. It does so by making it
        transparent to the user what steps were performed, by whom and in what
        order. As a result, with some guidance from the group creating the
        software, in-toto allows the user to verify if a step in the supply chain
        was intended to be performed, and if the step was performed by the
        right actor.
        </p>
