<h3>Ongoing Integrations</h3>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/repeatr.png"/></td>
      <td>
        We are actively working with <a href="https://repeatr.io">repeatr</a>
        to create a cross-compatible metadata format that can be both used
        for supply-chain step memoization and supply-chain security.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/reproducible-builds.svg"/></td>
      <td>
        We are participating with the reproducible builds community to
        improve the security properties of build systems. We are also
        integrating in-toto into reprotest, so that people can create in-toto
        metadta to attest for the reproducibility of a step.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/git.png"/></td>
      <td>
        We are working with the git community to improve the security model
        of git metadata signing. We have already integrated three series
        of patches to ensure GPG-signed git tags can't be spoofed. <!-- TODO: links -->
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/debian.png"/></td>
      <td>
        We are actively working with the debian community so that in-toto
        metadata is generated within Debian's software supply chain. In
        addition, we intend to have in-toto metadata be verified when using
        Debian's dpkg/apt toolchain.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/archlinux.png"/></td>
      <td>
        The Arch Linux community already included our patches
        <a href='#'>git tag verification</a>. We aim to have an integration
        similar to Debian's in the future.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/docker.png"></td>
      <td>
        Docker is currently trying out in-toto metadata internally to protect
        the security properties of their pipelines.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/opensuse.png"></td>
      <td>
        We have a demo deployment of opensuse's OBS using in-toto. We are
        working with the opensuse community to generate in-toto link metadata
        within their OBS services.

    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/control-plane.png"></td>
        <td>
         We are working actively with Control Plane to secure the software
         supply chain in cloud native integrations.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/question-mark.jpg"></td>

         We have major integration to announce soon. Keep tuned!
