        <td>
          We are actively working with <a href="https://repeatr.io">repeatr</a>
          to create a cross-compatible metadata format that can be both used
          for supply-chain step memoization and supply-chain security.

      <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/reproducible-builds.png"/></td>
        <td>
          We are participating with the reproducible builds community to
          improve the security properties of build systems. We are also
          integrating in-toto into reprotest, so that people can create in-toto
          metadta to attest for the reproducibility of a step.

      <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/git.png"/></td>
        <td>
          We are working with the git community to improve the security model
          of git metadata signing. We have already integrated three series
          of patches to ensure GPG-signed git tags can't be spoofed. <!-- TODO: links -->

      <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/debian.png"/></td>
        <td>
          We are actively working with the debian community so that in-toto
          metadata is generated within Debian's software supply chain. In
          addition, we intend to have in-toto metadata be verified when using
          Debian's dpkg/apt toolchain.

      <tr>
        <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/archlinux.png"/></td>
        <td>
          The Arch Linux community already included our patches
          <a href='#'>git tag verification</a>. We aim to have an integration
          similar to Debian's in the future.

          Docker is currently trying out in-toto metadata internally to protect
          the security properties of their pipelines.

          We have a demo deployment of opensuse's OBS using in-toto. We are
          working with the opensuse community to generate in-toto link metadata
          within their OBS services.
