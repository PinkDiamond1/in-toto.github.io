<h3>Ongoing Integrations</h3>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/repeatr.png"/></td>
      <td>
        We are actively working with <a href="https://repeatr.io">repeatr</a>
        to create a cross-compatible metadata format that can be both used
        for supply-chain step memoization and supply-chain security.
      </td>

    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/reproducible-builds.svg"/></td>
      <td>
        We are participating with the reproducible builds community to
        improve the security properties of build systems. We are also
        integrating in-toto into reprotest, so that people can create in-toto
        metadta to attest for the reproducibility of a step.

        You can set up your own rebuilder to reproduce debian packages and
        produce in-toto metadata by following the instructions <a
        href="https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/debian-rebuilder-setup">here</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/git.png"/></td>
      <td>
        We are working with the git community to improve the security model
        of git metadata signing. We have already integrated <a
            href='https://public-inbox.org/git/20170117233723.23897-1-santiago@nyu.edu/'>three
            series</a> of patches to ensure GPG-signed git tags can't be
        spoofed.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/debian.png"/></td>
      <td>
        We are actively working with the debian community so that in-toto
        metadata is generated within Debian's software supply chain. In
        addition, we intend to have in-toto metadata be verified when using
        Debian's dpkg/apt toolchain.

        You can take a look and play around with our debian apt-transport <a
            href='https://github.com/in-toto/apt-transport-in-toto'>here</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/archlinux.png"/></td>
      <td>
        The Arch Linux community already included our patches
        <a
            href='https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/pacman-dev/2017-September/022123.html'>git
            tag verification</a>. We aim to have an integration similar to
        Debian's in the future.

    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/docker.png"></td>
      <td>
        Docker is currently trying out in-toto metadata internally to protect
        the security properties of their pipelines.

    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/images/logos/opensuse.png"></td>
      <td>
        We have a demo deployment of opensuse's OBS using in-toto. We are
        working with the opensuse community to generate in-toto link metadata
        within their OBS services. You can take a look at how this would work today by taking a look at <a href='https://github.com/in-toto/demo-opensuse'>this repo</a>

         We are working actively with Control Plane to secure the software
         supply chain in cloud native integrations.
